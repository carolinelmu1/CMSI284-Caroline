Total possible points 100

========================================================

TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 100.00/100.00 which is 100% which is an A-plus

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 findGCD: PERFECT!

problem 2 findGCD with gcdFinder.c: I don't see a 'function-ized' version of
the findGCD.nasm program.  I can't link the gcdFinder.c program without it.

problem 3 paritygen: works, but not quite the way expected from the problem
statement.... I had to read the code, which your users won't be doing....

problem 4 whichEndIsUp: this one got a compile error.  You need to cast the
address of variable 'x' to a char *.  I commented the code so you can see
what I did, and fixed it for you so it'll work.

problem 5 makeNBO.c and tester: the "C" program has a segmentation fault.  I
can't run it and get any output.  You also need to make a second copy of the
function in its own file, or otherwise remove the main method from this code
so the assembler/compiler/linker won't get confused about which 'main()' to
use.

problem 6 makeNBO.nasm tesing "C" code: there are too many errors assembling
this code to try to even think about.  The big problem is there are TONS of
characters that seem to be incorrectly included in the source file.  I think
you have created the source file on a windows machine or something, but you
used 64-bit mac code, so on a mac edit the bogus characters show up and also
interfere with the compilation.  since that is your main program, I can't
evaluate it.


========================================================
SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~  95.00% of  5 points =  4.75 points
   homework03 ~  91.89% of  5 points =  4.60 points
   homework04 ~  97.78% of  5 points =  4.89 points
   homework05 ~  93.00% of 10 points =  9.30 points
   homework06 ~ 100.00% of 15 points = 15.00 points
                       semester total: 43.54 out of 45.00 = 96.76%
                             which is a solid A on the homeworks

Nice job on this!  This stuff is hard and you three did a very nice job all
semester long.  I hope to see you all in some of my future courses!

Re-evaluated after our conversations and re-vamping the github repo.

Nice work!

I would still like to see more output from the programs that use the 'assert()'
functions.  Simply displaying "all tests passed" at the end doesn't really
say much about what was tested, what values were used, or what was expected
and actually produced.  Keep this in mind for future work when testing.  It's
OK in many cases for 'unit tests' where you are just making sure your functions
work and pass their tests, but if you are testing an actual program that has
output which will be displayed to the user, more is better.

.....just sayin'......  :)
